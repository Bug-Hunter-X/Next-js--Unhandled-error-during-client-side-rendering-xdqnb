# Next.js Unhandled Client-Side Rendering Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications: unhandled errors during client-side rendering.  The error occurs when attempting to access a variable that hasn't been defined.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`. You should see an error in your browser's console.

## Solution

The solution involves proper error handling and ensuring that variables are defined before use.  This can involve using optional chaining or nullish coalescing operators, conditional rendering or other relevant approaches.

## Additional Notes

This error often manifests as a blank page or a generic error message, making it difficult to debug.  Always thoroughly inspect your browser's console for more details when encountering unexpected behavior in Next.js apps.
